Simple Implementations of Data Structures

Currently available:
1. Singly Linked List implemented in C.
2. Dynamic Array (based on underlying static array) implemented in Java.

Work(s) in progress: 
Doubly Linked List implemented using Python.

Code will all be converted to usable libraries once all implementations are deemed complete.
